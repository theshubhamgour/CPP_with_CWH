            Double-> Double is also used to store decimal numbers but has more precision than float, e.g. (10.5895758440339...)

*Data Types
Data types define the type of data that a variable can hold; for example, an integer variable can hold integer data, 
a character can hold character data, etc.

*Data types in C++ are categorized into three groups:

                                                        Built-in
                                                        User-defined
                                                        Derived
1. Built-in Data Types in C++:
                                Int
                                Float
                                Char
                                Double
                                Boolean

2. User-Defined Data Types in C++:
                                    Struct
                                    Union
                                    Enum

*Rules to Declare Variables in C++
                                    * Variable names in C++ language can range from 1 to 255
                                    * Variable names must start with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore
                                    * After the first letter, variable names can contain letters and numbers
                                    * Variable names are case sensitive
                                    * No spaces and special characters are allowed
                                    * We cannot use reserved keywords as a variable name
