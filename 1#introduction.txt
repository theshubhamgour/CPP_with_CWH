* What is programming, programming language, and why C++?

      Programming can be understood as your instructions to the computer(machine) to solve real problems. 
      The very basic principle of creating machines was to make life simpler and machines, on our instructions,
      have been able to do the same. But the distance between what we say and what the machine understands gets
        abridged by a programming language. This marks the importance of learning a programming language.

      A programming language helps us communicate with the computer. Analogous to us humans, who need some language, 
      be it English, Hindi, or Bangla, to talk to our people, computers too need a language to converse.  
      Just to name a few, there is C++, C, Python, Java, etc.

      Now when we start listing the names of these programming languages, the question which instinctively arises is why C++. 
      Despite this being an 80s programming language, it never lost its sheen. C++ was an added version of C developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. 
      It is believed to be very close to the hardware making it comparatively easy for programmers to give the instructions directly to the 
      system without any intermediary. Another reason for C++ to be one of the most used languages is its object-orientedness. 

      C++  is an object-oriented programming language giving it the power to create real-world software systems.
